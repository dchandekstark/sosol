    %strong NOTICE:
    The Papyrological Editor login system will change soon. If you're using one of the buttons below to sign in, we <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommend that you add a traditional password to your account by clicking on your account name in the top-right of the page after signing in. Doing so will ensure that you will still be able to sign in without interruption if the services below stop working. In addition, ensuring that the email address associated with your account is correct and goes to an email address which you can check will allow you to perform email-based account recovery should the need arise.
  %p While the "Social Login by Janrain" sign in process below has served us well for the past decade-plus, in the interest of stability and maintainability we're migrating to the new sign in process above which is able to support traditional password-based logins. This process also supports signing in or signing up with an existing Google account, which should be a seamless transition for the more than 80% of our users who sign in with Google.
  %p If you sign in with another third-party identity provider (Yahoo, Facebook, OpenID, Amazon, or Twitter), you can still use the old sign in method below for the time being. However, we may not be able to seamlessly transition all of these third-party services into the new sign in process.

      %h3 What is this?
      %p!== Instead of creating yet another username and password, #{Sosol::Application.config.site_name} will use your Google, AOL, Facebook, or Yahoo account. If you don't have one of these accounts, you can create an OpenID for free at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup">myOpenID.com</a>. If you have a Flickr, Blogger, or WordPress.com account, you may already have an OpenID through those services - click the OpenID logo and then the icon for the corresponding service, and it well help you find out your OpenID URL.

      %h3 Do I have to give you my password?
      %p!== <strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to the service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve #{Sosol::Application.config.site_name} to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong>
