    %h3 What is this?
    %p!== Instead of creating yet another username and password, #{Sosol::Application.config.site_name} will use your Google, AOL, Facebook, or Yahoo account. If you don't have one of these accounts, you can create an OpenID for free at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup">myOpenID.com</a>. If you have a Flickr, Blogger, or WordPress.com account, you may already have an OpenID through those services - click the OpenID logo and then the icon for the corresponding service, and it well help you find out your OpenID URL.

    %h3 Do I have to give you my password?
    %p!== <strong>No.</strong> After entering your info above, you will be taken to the service that you picked and enter your password there. Then you will be asked to approve #{Sosol::Application.config.site_name} to have limited access to basic information like your username and email address. Finally you will be redirected back here to finish signing up. <strong>We will never have access to your passwords or your accounts.</strong>
